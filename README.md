# 3d-audio-visualizer

This was a fun project I made to learn more about [Web Audio APIs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/API/Web_Audio_API) and 3D rendering with [Three.js](https://threejs.org/).

# Developing

```
git clone git@github.com:jonmellman/3d-audio-visualizer.git
cd 3d-audio-visualizer
python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8080
```

Just open your web browser and navigate to localhost:8080! Make sure to grant microphone access. Click and drag to manipulate the camera.
